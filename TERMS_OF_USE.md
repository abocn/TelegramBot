# Terms of Use

By using Kowalski ([@kowalski4tgbot](https://t.me/kowalski4tgbot), you agree to the terms outlined below. If you do not agree with any of these terms, please discontinue use of the bot immediately.

## 1. Blocklist System

We reserve the right to block users from accessing the bot based on their behavior. Users who generate inappropriate content or misuse the bot will be permanently blocked by user ID. Attempts to circumvent a block by using alternative or secondary accounts will also result in those accounts being blocked.

Additionally, Kowalski integrates with the SpamWatch API to automatically deny access to users banned by that system. If you are listed in SpamWatch, you will not be able to use the bot.

## 2. Source Code

The bot's source code is publicly available. You can review it at the Kowalski GitHub Repository:

## 3. Changes to These Terms

We may modify or update these Terms of Use at any time, with or without prior notice. Continued use of the bot constitutes acceptance of the latest version of the terms.
