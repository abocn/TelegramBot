Kowalski is meant to be highly configurable, but you may be wondering how you can do so. There are a few methods which this documentation will guide you through. We suggest starting with the [Environment Variables](/configuration/env) page.

## Configuration Methods

<Cards>
    <Card href="/configuration/env">
        <div className="flex flex-row items-center gap-4">
            <div className="not-prose w-fit shadow-md rounded-lg border bg-fd-muted p-1.5 text-fd-muted-foreground [&_svg]:size-4">
                <BookLock className="size-5" />
            </div>
            <div className="text-white">Environment Variables</div>
        </div>
    </Card>
    <Card href="/configuration/config">
        <div className="flex flex-row items-center gap-4">
            <div className="not-prose w-fit shadow-md rounded-lg border bg-fd-muted p-1.5 text-fd-muted-foreground [&_svg]:size-4">
                <Settings className="size-5" />
            </div>
            <div className="text-white">Configuration Files</div>
        </div>
    </Card>
</Cards>

## Making Modifications to Source

There are a few things you should know about the Kowalski codebase which can be useful to know before making source-level modifications.

### General Modifications

The most common modifications can be done in the `/config` directory. At the moment, `ai.ts` and `settings.ts` are the primary configuration files. We hope to expand the amount of easily-configurable settings in the future.

The settings in the `/config` directory are used throughout the bot and WebUI, so some settings will apply globally. You can see more information about this in the respective configuration files.

### WebUI

The WebUI is contained inside the `/webui` directory, and is a standard Next.js application.

We encourage contributors to continue with our current stack, in order to maintain consistency. This includes:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team)

### Bot

The Kowalski bot component is contained in the `/telegram` directory, and is a Telegraf bot.

You can find the commands, grouped into category files, in `/telegram/commands`. The main entrypoint is `/telegram/bot.ts`.

### Documentation

The documentation for Kowalski (what you're reading right now!) is contained in the `/docs` directory. It uses [Fumadocs](https://www.fumadocs.com).

You can find the actual content in `/docs/content`.
