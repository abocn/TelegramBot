You may also opt to run Kowalski without Docker on your local machine. This is not recommended for most users, as the setup and maintenance is more difficult.

However, if you want to run Kowalski this way, follow the steps below.

## Running Locally

<Steps>
<Step>
### Clone the repo

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ABOCN/TelegramBot
```
</Step>
<Step>
### Install dependencies

```bash
bun install # installs deps for bot
cd webui
bun install # installs deps for webui
```
</Step>
<Step>
### Deploy necessary components

- **Postgres**
  You will need a Postgres server for storing users
- **FFmpeg**
  Make sure FFmpeg is installed for video download commands
- **Ollama** (optional)
  If you want to use AI features, you will need to install [Ollama](https://ollama.com/).
</Step>
<Step>
### Setup your `.env`

In order to successfully deploy Kowalski, you will need to have a valid `.env`. An example is provided in `.env.example`. You will need to edit both your `.env` file and enter matching values in `webui/.env`. Don't worry... it's mostly copy-paste!

You can learn more about the different options in the [.env section](#env-functions).

</Step>
<Step>
### Run the bot and WebUI

```bash
chmod +x start-services.sh # makes the script executable
./start-services.sh # starts the bot and webui
```

<blockquote>
<div className="flex flex-row items-center gap-0.5 text-blue-400"><TbSparkles /> Note</div>
<div>
If you want to run the bot and webui separately, you can do so with:
```bash
# In terminal 1
bun start
# In terminal 2
cd webui
bun dev
```
</div>
</blockquote>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Efficient Local (w/ Docker) Development

If you want to develop a component of Kowalski, without dealing with the headache of several terminals, we suggest you follow these guidelines:

1. If you are working on one component, run it with Bun, and Dockerize the other components.
2. Minimize the amount of non-Dockerized components to reduce headaches.
3. You will have to change your `.env` a lot. This is a common source of issues. Make sure the hostname and port are correct.
