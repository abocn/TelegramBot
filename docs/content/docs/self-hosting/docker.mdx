Running Kowalski with Docker simplifies the setup, deployment, and management process significantly. Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed, then continue to the next steps.

## Running with Docker

<Steps>
<Step>
### Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ABOCN/TelegramBot
```
</Step>
<Step>
### Copy a Docker Compose file

_Without AI Features (Ollama)_

```bash
mv examples/docker-compose.yml docker-compose.yml
```

_With AI Features (Ollama)_

```bash
mv examples/docker-compose.ai.yml docker-compose.yml
```
</Step>
<Step>
### Setup your `.env`

In order to successfully deploy Kowalski, you will need to have a valid `.env`. An example is provided in `.env.example`. You will need to edit both your `.env` file and enter matching values in `webui/.env`. Don't worry... it's mostly copy-paste!

You can learn more about the different options in the [.env section](#env-functions).

Further setup may be needed for GPUs. See the [Ollama documentation](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/gpu.md) for more.</blockquote>
</Step>
<Step>
### Prepare the database

The WebUI and bot requires a Postgres database, which requires some setup. Again, don't worry as it's a pretty quick setup!

**Migrate the schema to DB:**

```bash
docker compose up postgres -d # Bring up just the database
bunx drizzle-kit push
```
</Step>
<Step>
### Run the container

You're all done! You can run the container with:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The web interface will be available at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). We suggest putting it a reverse proxy if you plan to use Kowalski for production use.
