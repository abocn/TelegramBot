import {TbAlertCircle} from "react-icons/tb";

<blockquote><div className="flex flex-row items-center gap-0.5 text-red-500"><TbAlertCircle /> Important</div> Take care of your ``.env`` file, as it is so much important and needs to be secret (like your passwords), as anyone can do whatever they want to the bot with this token!</blockquote>

### Bot

- **botSource**: Put the link to your bot source code.
- **botPrivacy**: Put the link to your bot privacy policy.

- **ollamaEnabled** (optional): Enables/disables AI features
- **ollamaApi** (optional): Ollama API endpoint for various AI features, will be disabled if not set
- **handlerTimeout** (optional): How long handlers will wait before timing out. Set this high if using large AI models.
- **flashModel** (optional): Which model will be used for /ask
- **thinkingModel** (optional): Which model will be used for /think
- **updateEveryChars** (optional): The amount of chars until message update triggers (for streaming response)
- **databaseUrl**: Database server configuration (see `.env.example`)
- **valkeyBaseUrl**: The hostname of your Valkey instance.
- **valkeyPort**: The port of your Valkey instance.
- **botAdmins**: Put the ID of the people responsible for managing the bot. They can use some administrative + exclusive commands on any group.
- **lastKey**: Last.fm API key, for use on `lastfm.js` functions, like see who is listening to what song and etc.
- **weatherKey**: Weather.com API key, used for the `/weather` command.
- **longerLogs**: Set to `true` to enable verbose logging whenever possible.

<blockquote><div className="flex flex-row items-center gap-0.5 text-blue-400"><TbAlertCircle /> Note</div> Further, advanced fine-tuning and configuration can be done in TypeScript with the files in the `/config` folder.</blockquote>

### WebUI

- **botApiUrl**: Likely will stay the same, but changes the API that the bot exposes
- **databaseUrl**: Database server configuration (see `.env.example`). Should match `.env`
- **valkeyBaseUrl**: The hostname of your Valkey instance. Should match `.env`
- **valkeyPort**: The port of your Valkey instance. Should match `.env`
- **ratelimitSalt**: The salt used for hashing IP addresses in Valkey. **This should be changed in production.**
- **longerLogs**: Set to `true` to enable verbose logging whenever possible.
