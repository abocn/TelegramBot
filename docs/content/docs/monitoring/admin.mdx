The suggested method of monitoring Kowalski is through the admin dashboard. You can find it at [http://localhost:3000/admin/monitoring](http://localhost:3000/admin/monitoring), where `localhost:3000` is the URL to your Kowalski instances' WebUI.

At this time, it does not require documentation, though you can [submit an Issue](https://github.com/abocn/TelegramBot/issues) if you need help.
