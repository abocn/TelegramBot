ABOCN and its contributors are happy to present you with the official Kowalski documentation.

We've done our best to make it as comprehensive and easy to follow as possible, but if any issues arise, you can always make an [Issue on GitHub](https://github.com/abocn/TelegramBot/issues)!

Sometimes referred to as "TelegramBot" or "Kowalski," it is a highly-extendable Telegram bot and WebUI written in TypeScript using [Bun](https://bun.sh).

The WebUI uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

On the less technical side, it's just a fun bot for your DMs or group! Our goal is to provide a wide variety of features and commands, while providing the means to add more which fit your interests.

## What makes Kowalski different?

What makes Kowalski special is its modular design. We want to make it as easy as possible for developers or new contributors to add new features, or modify existing ones.

For example, we're written APIs for both the bot and WebUI, allowing you to directly communicate with either inside of your code. And they're well-documented, too!

While we're always still working on building Kowalski, our main point is that we don't want to lock you in or make it difficult to contribute. Many repositories have a high barrier to entry, and we want to refrain from these practices.

## How can I contribute?

Kowalski is very much in need of contributors! If you want to help out, please check out our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/abocn/TelegramBot/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), then make your way to a pull request/issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/abocn/TelegramBot)!

We welcome all kinds of contributions, whether it's fixing a typo in the documentation, or adding a new feature. Every little bit helps!
